# Overview
  ![image](./static/img/swdd_demo.jpg)
  
## Introduction

SWDD (Steam Workshop Description Downloader) is a project created by criskkky with the purpose to allow download descriptions for workshop published items by other users.

## How it works

SWDD extracts the description of a published content in Steam workshop through functions in JavaScript that were called by clicking one of those green download buttons provided at the end of the desired description.
The format of the downloaded file depends on your selection (currently supports `.bbcode` or `.md`), you will get your file inmediate 'cos it's not made through a server, it makes a real-time conversion and file deployment.

This function is quite useful for developers who may need to replicate the description posted on Steam or in the case of uploading modified editions of another addon, we also need to write exactly the same content as in the original post along with minor changes.

## Common Inquiries
<ol>
  <li>Your data is <b>NOT</b> collected.
  <li>This code is <b>NOT</b> against Steam TOS, so <b>you won't receive</b> a <b>VAC BAN</b>.
  <li>If it doesn't work, there's a 99% chance it's due to compatibility issues with other userscripts or addons. Disabling them could help.
  <li>Downloads are <b>unlimited</b>, so don't worry about how many downloads are you allowed to do.
  <li>I avoided the use of libs (enhancing code transparency, FREE from cheats, tricks, or hidden things).
  <li>Script won't ask you grant permissions.
  <li>To keep your code updated you must not touch the original code.
</ol>
